# MyReads Project

This is the first of two projects for the Udacity React Nanodegree program; to practice and solidify some of the React concepts taught during the course of the program, like components, states, etc.

## App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

At the bottom of the page, there is a floating action button to open the search page, where users can look up books and add them to the three shelves listed above.
